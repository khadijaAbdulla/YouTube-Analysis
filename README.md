2. Access the Dataset Link from the Source link and Download the dataset CSV file from Kaggle.
3. Unzip the dataset file and make sure that it is in the same file location as the python file. 
4. Open the python file using Jupyter Notebook/Jupyter Lab. For the installation instructions kindly follow the steps mentioned in the official documentaion [https://jupyter.org/install](url)
5. Make sure to install any depenedcies(mentioned below) before running the code e.g. Pip install dependency-name.
6. Run the full python code by navigating to the **Run** menu and click **Run All cells**.

### Limitations & Future Work:
Since the YouTube algorithm changes over time and this dataset is limited to two years only(2007-2018), if we had more recent data, we could compare between the factors that effect the how popular a video is over the years.
